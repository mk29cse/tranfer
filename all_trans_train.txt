yes
will be for inn network or out of network
inn
so inn network the benefits will be covered at 80 percent of eligible expenses after satisfying the deductible
coming on towards the deductible and out of pocket so there is no individual deductible and out of pocket this is a calendar year plan so for the family inn network the deductible limit is 2700 dollars that is two seven zero zero the patient have met the whole amount coming on towards the out of pocket limit which is 7500 dollars the patient has met 3333 dollars and 90 cents that is three three three three point nine o
so as the patient has met the deductible fully the plan now covers at 80 percent of eligible expenses 20 percent will be the patients responsibility
so was the out of pocket has been met it will be cover at 100 percent with no patients responsibility
and let me tell you rehabilitation services must be performed by a licensed therapy provider under the direction of a physician
and last part would be benefits are available only for rehabilitation services that are expected to result in significant physical improvement in your condition within two months of the start of treatment ok and for physical therapy there will be a combination of network and non network benefits 20 visits 20 visits of physical therapy per calendar year ok
ok

let me give you visit limitation for chiropractic services it shows me that they having 25 visits for the chiropractic services and only spinal manipulation applies towards its limit for inn and out of network providers combine
however out of those 25 visits i can see of so far nothing has been used by the member as of now and the most beautiful news is that authorizations are not required for out of network providers
